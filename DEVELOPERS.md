# Developer Guide

## Development Environment: Dev Container

This project comes with a [development container (or dev container)](https://containers.dev) setup, which allows for a reproducible development environment.
To get started with the development, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [VS Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [VS Code: Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- [VS Code: Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

After the installation, start the Docker Desktop application. There are two ways you can launch a dev container:

1. Simply click the following button:

   <a href="https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/estripling/sparkit
"><img alt="Open Dev Containers" src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode"></a>

   This will automatically clone the repository and open it in a dev container straightaway.

2. Clone the repository manually and open it in VS Code using the `Open Folder` option.
   VS Code will prompt you to reopen the folder in a dev container, click the `Reopen in Container` button.

Once the dev container has been created, you are all set and ready to code!

## Things To Try

The `Makefile` provides a collection of common shell commands.
Open a new terminal and run the following command to see what is available:

```shell
make help
```

This will allow you, for example, to easily check for code style errors, run tests, or all at once using only one command.
Try to run the tests to make sure everything works as intended.
Code on the main branch must have neither code style errors nor failing tests.

## Git Commit Guidelines

The commit style of sparkit is the [Angular style](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines), but used as suggested in this [Git commit messages guide](https://py-pkgs.org/07-releasing-versioning#automatic-version-bumping) for automatic version bumping with the help of the [Python Semantic Release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tool.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.
The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject**:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

(<body>: explains motivation for the change)

(<footer>: note BREAKING CHANGES here, and issues to be closed)
```

The **header** is mandatory but the **scope** of the header is optional.
The **subject** is a short summary in present tense.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters!
This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header
of the reverted commit.
In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit
being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature.
* **fix**: A bug fix.
* **docs**: Documentation changes.
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (whitespace, formatting, missing comma).
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
* **test**: Changes to the test framework, i.e., adding missing or correcting existing tests.
* **build**: Changes to the build process or tools.

### Scope

The scope is an optional keyword that provides context for where the change was made.
It can be anything relevant to your package or development workflow (e.g., it could be the module or function name affected by the change).

You can use `*` when the change affects more than a single scope.

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
* Do not capitalize first letter.
* No period (.) at the end.

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
[reference GitHub issues that this commit closes](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.
The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

## Docstring Guidelines

### General

General docstring convention in Python is described in [Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 257 â€” Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), but there is flexibility in how you write your docstrings ([source](https://py-pkgs.org/03-how-to-package-a-python#writing-docstrings)).
A minimal docstring contains a single line describing what the object does, and that might be sufficient for a simple function or for when your code is in the early stages of development.
However, for code you intend to share with others (including your future self) a more comprehensive docstring should be written.
A typical docstring will include:

1. A one-line summary that does not use variable names or the function name.
2. An extended description.
3. Parameter types and descriptions.
4. Returned value types and descriptions.
5. Example usage.
6. Potentially more.

### Docstring Guidelines

There are different docstring styles available:

* [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard)
* [Google](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)
* [sphinx](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html#the-sphinx-docstring-format)
* [DM Python Style Guide](https://developer.lsst.io/python/style.html#)

This package uses the [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) style, because it is readable, commonly used, and supported by [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_numpy.html).
In the numpydoc style:

* Section headers are denoted as text underlined with dashes:
  ```text
  Parameters
  ----------
  ```

* Input arguments are denoted as:
  ```text
  name : type
      Description of parameter `name`.
  ```

* Output values use the same syntax above, but specifying the `name` is optional.
  ```text
  Returns
  -------
  int
      Description of anonymous integer return value.
  ```

  If both the name and type are specified, the Returns section takes the same form as the Parameters section:
  ```text
  Returns
  -------
  err_code : int
      Non-zero value indicates error code, or zero on success.
  err_msg : str or None
      Human readable error message, or None on success.
  ```

### Example:

```python
def function_with_types_in_docstring(param1, param2):
    """Example function with types documented in the docstring.

    The one-line summary immediately follows the triple double quotes
    and ends with a dot. There is no blank line before the closing triple
    double quotes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param1 : int
        The first parameter.
    param2 : str
        The second parameter.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if successful, False otherwise.
    """
    return param1 == int(param2)
```
